## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Docker and Docker Compose installed
2. Urbanclear system running with all services
3. Prometheus metrics enabled in the API

### Quick Start
1. **Start the system**:
   ```bash
   make start
   ```

2. **Access Grafana**:
   - URL: http://localhost:3000
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `grafana_password`

3. **Navigate to dashboards**:
   - Go to "Dashboards" ‚Üí "Browse"
   - Look for dashboards tagged with "urbanclear"
   - Start with "System Overview" for the main dashboard

### Configuration
- **Prometheus datasource**: Pre-configured to connect to `http://prometheus:9090`
- **Refresh intervals**: Set from 30s to 5m depending on dashboard purpose
- **Time ranges**: Default to 1-24 hours with option to customize

## üìà Key Metrics Explained

### Traffic Metrics
- **Traffic Flow Rate**: Percentage of road capacity being used (0-100%)
- **Congestion Level**: Classification of traffic density (Free, Light, Heavy, Gridlock)
- **Sensor Coverage**: Number and location of active traffic sensors

### Incident Metrics
- **Active Incidents**: Current unresolved traffic incidents
- **Severity Levels**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Response Time**: Time from incident detection to first response
- **Resolution Time**: Average time to fully resolve incidents

### System Metrics
- **API Performance**: Request rate, response times, error rates
- **Database Health**: Connection count, query performance, size
- **Cache Efficiency**: Redis hit rates, memory usage
- **Service Uptime**: Availability of critical system components

### Prediction Metrics
- **Model Accuracy**: Percentage accuracy of ML predictions
- **Prediction Error**: Difference between predicted and actual values
- **Feature Importance**: Which factors most influence predictions
- **Optimization Impact**: Improvements from route/signal optimization

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Panels
1. Edit dashboard JSON files or use Grafana UI
2. Use existing Prometheus metrics or add new ones
3. Follow naming convention: `urbanclear_[metric_name]`

### Creating Alerts
1. Set up alert rules in Grafana
2. Configure notification channels (Slack, email, etc.)
3. Use thresholds based on your operational requirements

### Custom Metrics
Add new metrics to the FastAPI application:
```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Gauge, Histogram

# Example: Custom traffic metric
CUSTOM_METRIC = Gauge('urbanclear_custom_metric', 'Description', ['label'])
CUSTOM_METRIC.labels('value').set(123)
```

## üé® Visual Features

### Color Coding
- **Green**: Normal/Healthy (0-50%)
- **Yellow**: Warning/Moderate (50-70%)
- **Orange**: High/Concerning (70-90%)
- **Red**: Critical/Severe (90-100%)

### Chart Types
- **Time Series**: Trends over time
- **Gauges**: Current status indicators  
- **Bar Charts**: Comparative analysis
- **Pie Charts**: Distribution visualization
- **Heatmaps**: Pattern identification
- **Geographic Maps**: Spatial visualization
- **Tables**: Detailed data views

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Data Showing**
   - Check Prometheus is running and accessible
   - Verify API is exposing `/metrics` endpoint
   - Ensure time range includes data points

2. **Dashboard Import Errors**
   - Validate JSON syntax
   - Check Grafana version compatibility
   - Verify datasource configuration

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Reduce time ranges for heavy queries
   - Optimize Prometheus query intervals
   - Check system resource usage

### Log Locations
- Grafana logs: `/var/log/grafana/`
- Prometheus logs: Check Docker container logs
- API metrics: `/metrics` endpoint

## üìä Dashboard Usage Tips

### For Traffic Operations
1. Start with System Overview
2. Monitor Traffic Flow Dashboard during peak hours
3. Use Geographic Map for spatial analysis
4. Set up alerts for high incident counts

### For System Administration
1. Focus on System Performance Dashboard
2. Monitor resource usage trends
3. Set up alerting for service downtime
4. Track API performance metrics

### For Strategic Planning
1. Use Predictive Analytics for forecasting
2. Analyze incident patterns over time
3. Monitor model accuracy trends
4. Review optimization effectiveness

## üîê Security Considerations

- Change default Grafana admin password
- Configure authentication (LDAP, OAuth, etc.)
- Restrict dashboard editing permissions
- Use HTTPS in production
- Regular backup of dashboard configurations

## üìù Contributing

When adding new dashboards:
1. Follow naming convention: `urbanclear-[purpose]-dashboard.json`
2. Add appropriate tags: `["urbanclear", "category"]`
3. Include description and documentation
4. Test with sample data
5. Update this README

## üìû Support

For issues or questions:
- Check logs first
- Review Prometheus metrics availability
- Verify system connectivity
- Consult Grafana documentation for panel-specific issues
