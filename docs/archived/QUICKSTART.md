# Urbanclear Quick Start Guide 🚀

Welcome to **Urbanclear** - your AI-powered smart city traffic optimization system! This guide will get you up and running quickly with all the enhanced features.

## 🎯 What We've Fixed & Enhanced

### ✅ API Endpoints Fixed
- **Traffic Data**: `/api/v1/traffic/current` now returns realistic traffic conditions
- **Analytics**: `/api/v1/analytics/summary` provides comprehensive traffic analytics
- **Predictions**: `/api/v1/traffic/predict` generates realistic traffic forecasts
- **Route Optimization**: `/api/v1/routes/optimize` provides intelligent routing
- **Incident Management**: Full incident detection and reporting system

### ✅ Enhanced Mock Data Generator
- **Realistic Traffic Patterns**: Rush hour simulation, time-based variations
- **Geographic Accuracy**: NYC-based sensors with real coordinates
- **Weather Impact**: Dynamic weather-based traffic modifications
- **Incident Simulation**: Realistic traffic incidents with proper impact zones

### ✅ Working ML Models
- **Traffic Prediction**: LSTM-based forecasting with confidence scores
- **Route Optimization**: Multi-factor route planning with alternatives
- **Incident Detection**: Anomaly detection with real-time alerts
- **Performance Analytics**: System-wide efficiency monitoring

### ✅ **Python 3.12 Compatibility**
- **Updated numpy**: From 1.24.3 to >=1.25.0 (fixes build errors)
- **Updated all packages**: Compatible versions for Python 3.12
- **Multiple install options**: Core, minimal, and full installations
- **Better error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing packages

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### 1. Complete System Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Full system with minimal dependencies - FASTEST
make quick-start

# OR with all ML/AI packages (takes longer)
make quick-start-full
```

### 2. Minimal Setup (Core Features Only)
```bash
# Install only essential packages
make install-core

# Start services
make start

# Start API
make api
```

### 3. Choose Your Installation Style
```bash
# Minimal but functional (recommended for first run)
make install

# All features and ML packages
make install-full

# Core packages only (fastest)
make install-core

# Using conda instead of pip
make install-conda
```

### 4. Development Setup
```bash
# Full development environment
make dev-install
make dev-all
```

## 🛠️ Python Compatibility

### Python 3.12 Support ✅
This project is fully compatible with Python 3.12! We've updated all dependencies to work with the latest Python version.

### Installation Troubleshooting

**If you see numpy build errors:**
```bash
# Use the minimal installation first
make install-core

# Then gradually add more packages
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib plotly
```

**If pip installation fails:**
```bash
# Update pip and setuptools first
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# Try minimal installation
make install

# Alternative: use conda
make install-conda
```

**For M1/M2 Macs:**
```bash
# Some packages work better with conda on Apple Silicon
conda install -c conda-forge numpy pandas scikit-learn
make install-core
```
