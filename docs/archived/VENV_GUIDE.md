# Urbanclear Virtual Environment Guide üêç

## üéØ **Why Virtual Environments Are Essential**

Virtual environments provide **isolated Python environments** for your projects, preventing conflicts and ensuring reproducible setups.

### ‚úÖ **Benefits**:
- **No package conflicts** with other projects
- **Exact dependency versions** for reproducibility  
- **Clean project isolation** 
- **Easy cleanup** when done
- **Professional development practice**

### ‚ùå **Without Virtual Environment**:
- Global package pollution
- Version conflicts between projects
- Difficult to reproduce exact setup
- Hard to clean up afterwards

---

## üöÄ **Quick Setup (Already Done!)**

‚úÖ **Your virtual environment is already created and activated!**

You can see `(urbanclear-env)` in your terminal prompt, which means:
- ‚úÖ Virtual environment is active
- ‚úÖ All packages are isolated to this project
- ‚úÖ Python dependencies are properly managed

---

## üîÑ **Daily Workflow**

### **Starting Work Session**
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/traffic-system

# Activate virtual environment
source urbanclear-env/bin/activate

# You should see (urbanclear-env) in your prompt
# Now you can run any Urbanclear commands
```

### **Working Commands**
```bash
# All these work within the activated virtual environment
make api                    # Start API
make start                  # Start Docker services
python scripts/test_api.py  # Run tests
pip install new-package     # Add new dependencies
```

### **Ending Work Session**
```bash
# Deactivate virtual environment when done
deactivate

# Your prompt should return to normal (no more (urbanclear-env))
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Virtual Environment Commands**

### **Activation & Deactivation**
```bash
# Activate (run this every time you start working)
source urbanclear-env/bin/activate

# Deactivate (when you're done working)
deactivate

# Check if activated (should show virtual env path)
which python
```

### **Package Management**
```bash
# Inside virtual environment - install packages
pip install package-name

# View installed packages
pip list

# Save current environment to requirements
pip freeze > requirements-current.txt

# Install from requirements
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
```

### **Virtual Environment Info**
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version

# Check Python location (should show urbanclear-env path)
which python

# Check virtual environment status
echo $VIRTUAL_ENV
```

## üìù **Updated Makefile Commands**

The Makefile has been updated to work with virtual environments:

### **Installation Commands**
```bash
make install         # Install minimal dependencies
make install-full    # Install all ML/AI packages  
make install-core    # Install only essential packages
```

### **Virtual Environment Setup**
```bash
# Create and setup virtual environment
make venv-create     # Create new virtual environment
make venv-install    # Install packages in virtual environment
```

### **Development Commands**
```bash
# These automatically work with your active virtual environment
make api            # Start API server
make test-api       # Run API tests
make demo           # Run demo endpoints
```

---

## üéØ **Best Practices**

### **DO** ‚úÖ
- **Always activate** the virtual environment before working: `source urbanclear-env/bin/activate`
- **Check the prompt** shows `(urbanclear-env)` before running commands
- **Install packages** only when virtual environment is active
- **Use the virtual environment** for all development work

### **DON'T** ‚ùå
- **Don't install packages globally** (without virtual environment active)
- **Don't forget to activate** the virtual environment
- **Don't delete** the `urbanclear-env` folder (it contains all your packages)

---

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Virtual Environment Not Working?**
```bash
# Check if it exists
ls -la urbanclear-env/

# Recreate if needed  
rm -rf urbanclear-env
python -m venv urbanclear-env
source urbanclear-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
```

### **Wrong Python Version?**
```bash
# Check which Python is being used
which python
python --version

# Should show:
# /path/to/traffic-system/urbanclear-env/bin/python
# Python 3.12.4
```

### **Packages Not Found?**
```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
source urbanclear-env/bin/activate

# Reinstall packages
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
```

---

## üéä **You're All Set!**

### **Current Status** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Virtual environment created**: `urbanclear-env/`
- ‚úÖ **Environment activated**: See `(urbanclear-env)` in prompt
- ‚úÖ **Packages installed**: All Urbanclear dependencies ready
- ‚úÖ **API tested**: Everything working correctly

### **Next Steps**
1. **Keep the virtual environment activated** while working
2. **Run the API**: `make api` or `cd src && python -m uvicorn api.main:app --reload`
3. **Test everything**: `make demo` once API is running
4. **Develop features**: All development happens in the virtual environment

### **Remember**
- **Activate when starting**: `source urbanclear-env/bin/activate`
- **Deactivate when done**: `deactivate`
- **Check prompt**: Should show `(urbanclear-env)`

üöÄ **Happy coding with proper virtual environment management!**
